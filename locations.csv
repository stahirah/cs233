SL-0073,"A contractile vacuole (CV) complex is a membrane-bound osmoregulatory organelle of fresh water and soil amoebae and protozoa which segregates excess cytosolic water, acquired osmotically, and expel it to the cell exterior, so that the cytosolic osmolarity is kept constant under a given osmotic condition. Depending on the organism, the CV complex (CVC) shows different degrees of specialization of its tubular and vesicular elements. In the most elaborate CVCs of certain ciliates, e.g. Paramecium, a central vacuole, the contractile vacuole or cisterna, is surrounded by radially oriented ampullae or radial arms. These ampullae are connected to a network of channels. Excess cytosolic water, acquired osmotically, is segregated by the radial arms and enters the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells (the fluid-filling phase). The vacuole then rounds (the rounding phase) and the radial arms sever from the vacuole. The vacuole membrane then fuses with the plasma membrane at the pore region and the pore opens. The vacuole shrinks as its fluid is discharged through the pore (the fluid-discharging phase). The pore closes when the fluid has been discharged. The radial arms then reattach to the vacuole, so that the vacuole swells again as the fluid enters from the arms (the next fluid-filling phase).",Cellular component,Contractile vacuole
